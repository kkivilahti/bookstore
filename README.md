# Backend Programming Course Exercise: Bookstore
This is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app designed to manage books and categories in a bookstore. 
It allows users to add, update, and delete books and categories, and provides user authentication for secure access.

## Technologies Used

- **Java / Spring Boot**: For building the backend services.
- **H2 Database**: An in-memory database for quick development and testing.
- **Spring Security**: For handling user authentication and securing the application.
- **Thymeleaf**: Used for rendering HTML pages.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling, although design was not the main focus of the project and is not fully polished

## Test the App
The app is available on CSC Rahti for a limited time: [try it out](https://bookstore-bookstore-exercise.2.rahtiapp.fi/)

You can also test the app locally by cloning the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kkivilahti/bookstore.git

**Test users:** user/user, admin/admin
